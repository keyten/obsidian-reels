# Obsidian Reels
This plugin downloads reels from instagram and saves them to your vault.

## Installation

After installing the plugin, you need to set the folder to save the reels in the settings.

## Usage

Place a code block with the `reel` type, and include the link to an instagram reel:
````markdown
```reel
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_8888888888/
```
````

Once the plugin detects the reel, it will download it and save it to the folder specified in the settings.
